This project is about to tracking my job applications with automation

Tools:
Java, Gradle, Cucumber, Google Sheets API

Project purpose:
I am currently in a job searching phase and need to track all of my applications from one central location. I tried using some apps for this purpose, but they always require upgrading to a premium profile. As a workaround, I created a Google Sheets document where I enter all the necessary information about the jobs I apply to. 
However, I realized that this manual process becomes repetitive over time, prompting me to explore the possibility of creating an automation solution. 
After extensive research, I dedicated myself to developing such a solution.
